# Descriptions
This folder contains my notes for some literature (especially books) and courses (textbooks, handouts and even some of my homeworks).

The folder is not designed for storage but for organizing notes. The notes differ from the dissertations in the aspect of innovation, creativity and originality.

Certainly, some of the note of lectures are summary essays, however, most of them are to help me to grasp the new concepts efficiently instead of expression my own opinions. Only the excellent essays after digestion (fully understanding) will be sorted as dissertations.
